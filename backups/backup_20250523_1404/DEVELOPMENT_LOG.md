## Technical Decisions & Notes

### Database Schema
- Implemented a festival-centric design where most entities relate to a specific festival
- Used UUID for primary keys to ensure uniqueness across potential future multi-tenant setup
- Implemented strict RLS policies for data security

### Storage Configuration
- Created separate buckets for different types of content:
  - Profile avatars (private)
  - Signed waivers (restricted)
  - Festival maps (public read)
  - Performance media (public read)

### Authentication
- Using email/password authentication initially
- Role-based access control implemented through user_roles table
- Helper functions created for role checking

## Issues & Solutions

### Resolved
1. JWT claims setup
   - Issue: Initial JWT claims weren't properly configured
   - Solution: Updated migration files with correct JWT handling

2. Profile Creation
   - Issue: Automatic profile creation trigger wasn't firing
   - Solution: Implemented proper trigger function with error handling

3. Storage Policies
   - Issue: Public access to festival maps wasn't working
   - Solution: Added separate SELECT policies for public access

### Current Challenges
1. Real-time subscription filtering
2. Complex asset tracking queries
3. Weather data integration

## Next Steps
1. Implement frontend components for volunteer management
2. Set up email notification system
3. Integrate weather API
4. Deploy initial version
