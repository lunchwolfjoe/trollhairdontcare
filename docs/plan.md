# TrollHairDontCare Rebuild Plan (Product & Engineering)

## Overview

This document outlines our plan to rebuild the TrollHairDontCare festival management system from scratch. We will reuse (and refactor as needed) existing UI code (for example, from the frontend-new folder) and any other sensible components, but the entire stack (backend, authentication, middleware, user management, and integration) will be rebuilt and thoroughly tested as we go.

## Goals

- Rebuild a robust, secure, and scalable festival management system.
- Address past issues (especially in authentication, middleware, and user management) by re-architecting and reimplementing the backend (using Supabase) and frontend (React/TypeScript) stack.
- Ensure that the new system meets all documented requirements (see BACKEND_SUPABASE.md, FRONTEND.md, DATABASE_MODEL.md, SUPABASE_SETUP.md, SUPABASE_CONFIG_RULES.md, and INTEGRATION_PLAN.md) and is thoroughly tested.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Planning & Requirements Review

- **Product Review:**  
  - Review all documentation (BACKEND_SUPABASE.md, FRONTEND.md, DATABASE_MODEL.md, SUPABASE_SETUP.md, SUPABASE_CONFIG_RULES.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md, TODO.md, etc.) to gather and refine requirements.
  - Identify (and document) the "must-have" features (e.g., volunteer coordination, communication, mapping, public interaction) and "nice-to-have" features.
  - Draft a revised (or new) product roadmap and sprint plan.

- **Engineering Review:**  
  - Audit the existing code (especially in frontend-new, middleware.ts, and any SQL setup scripts (e.g., db_setup.sql, minimal_db_setup.sql, final_fix.sql, etc.)) to identify reusable UI components, legacy issues (e.g., authentication, middleware, user management), and areas for refactoring.
  - Decide on a "rebuild" approach (e.g., "lift and shift" for UI, "rewrite" for backend, "re-architect" for middleware and auth) and document the new architecture (e.g., a revised Supabase schema, a new middleware design, and a robust user management flow).

- **Deliverable:**  
  - A consolidated "rebuild" plan (this document) and a revised (or new) sprint backlog.

### Phase 2: Rebuild (Backend & Frontend)

- **Backend (Supabase) Rebuild:**  
  - Recreate (or update) the Supabase database schema (using scripts such as db_setup.sql, minimal_db_setup.sql, final_fix.sql, etc.) and ensure that the schema is secure (e.g., RLS policies, proper permissions) and scalable.
  - Rebuild (or refactor) the authentication, middleware, and user management modules (e.g., using Supabase Auth, custom middleware (middleware.ts), and robust user roles/permissions).
  - Write (or update) backend integration tests (e.g., using a test suite or manual verification) to ensure that the backend behaves as expected.

- **Frontend (React/TypeScript) Rebuild:**  
  - Reuse (and refactor as needed) existing UI code (for example, from the frontend-new folder) to build a modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface.
  - Integrate the new backend (e.g., using Supabase client, custom hooks, and robust error handling) and ensure that the frontend "talks" to the backend securely (e.g., via middleware, proper auth tokens, and error handling).
  - Write (or update) frontend unit and integration tests (e.g., using Jest, React Testing Library, or Cypress) to ensure that the UI behaves as expected.

- **Deliverable:**  
  - A "rebuild" branch (or branches) with a new (or updated) backend (Supabase) and frontend (React/TypeScript) code, along with a suite of (unit and integration) tests.

### Phase 3: Testing & QA

- **Integration & End-to-End Testing:**  
  - Run (or update) integration tests (e.g., using a test suite or manual verification) to ensure that the backend and frontend "talk" to each other as expected.
  - Conduct end-to-end (E2E) tests (e.g., using Cypress or manual "happy path" and "edge case" testing) to simulate real-world usage (e.g., volunteer sign-up, festival mapping, communication, etc.) and catch any regressions or bugs.

- **Security & Performance Testing:**  
  - Conduct a security audit (e.g., review RLS policies, middleware, auth flows, and error handling) to ensure that the system is secure (e.g., no hardcoded secrets, proper error messages, and robust auth).
  - Run performance tests (e.g., load testing, stress testing, and profiling) to ensure that the system is scalable and performant (e.g., fast page loads, minimal latency, and efficient DB queries).

- **Deliverable:**  
  - A "test" branch (or a "staging" environment) with a "green" test suite, a security audit report, and a performance report.

### Phase 4: Deployment & Go-Live

- **Deployment:**  
  - Deploy the "rebuild" (or "test") branch to a staging (or production) environment (e.g., using Vercel, or a custom CI/CD pipeline as outlined in DEPLOYMENT.md and DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md).
  - Conduct a final "smoke test" (or "go-live" checklist) to ensure that the system is "live" and "usable" (e.g., no 500 errors, proper auth, and a "happy" volunteer flow).

- **Post-Go-Live:**  
  - Monitor the system (e.g., using logging, alerts, and dashboards) and gather feedback (e.g., from end-users, stakeholders, and the team) to iterate and improve the system further.

- **Deliverable:**  
  - A "live" (or "production") branch (or environment) with a "go-live" report and a post-mortem (or lessons learned) document.

## Next Steps

- Schedule a "kick-off" meeting (or a series of sprint planning meetings) to review (and refine) this plan, assign tasks, and set milestones.
- Begin **Phase 1** (Planning & Requirements Review) by auditing the documentation (e.g., BACKEND_SUPABASE.md, FRONTEND.md, DATABASE_MODEL.md, SUPABASE_SETUP.md, SUPABASE_CONFIG_RULES.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md, TODO.md, etc.) and the existing code (e.g., frontend-new, middleware.ts, and SQL setup scripts).
- Draft (or update) a sprint backlog (or a "rebuild" backlog) and start coding (or refactoring) in **Phase 2**.
