# Authentication & Login Issues - Summary of Changes

## Issues Identified

1. **Authentication Flow Problems**:
   - The original code was sending the anonymous API key as both the `apikey` header AND the `Authorization` header token during login, causing a 401 Unauthorized error.
   - Debug logs showed error: `DEBUG: No token available to debug` suggesting token management issues.
   - The app had mixed development and production code causing potential state conflicts.

2. **Development-only Code in Production**:
   - Mock login functionality (`mockSignIn`) was accessible in production builds.
   - Debug components like `SupabaseDebugger` and test routes were present in the production app.
   - Excessive console logging exposed sensitive information.

3. **Auth Context Issues**:
   - Using direct fetch API calls instead of Supabase client library for some operations.
   - Inconsistent error handling and state management.

## Changes Made

1. **SimpleAuthContext.tsx**:
   - Removed all debug logs and console statements.
   - Removed the `mockSignIn` function and references.
   - Removed the `debugToken` function.
   - Fixed the `fetchUserRoles` function to use the Supabase client library instead of direct fetch.
   - Simplified sign-in flow and removed unnecessary cookie options.
   - Ensured proper typing with TypeScript.

2. **SimpleLogin.tsx**:
   - Removed the entire "Quick Access for Testing" section that allowed bypassing normal authentication.
   - Removed unused imports and simplified the component.
   - Ensured proper error handling and display.

3. **App.tsx**:
   - Removed all development-only routes and components.
   - Removed the Dev Tools button and related functionality.
   - Simplified the loading state UI.
   - Removed `SupabaseDebugger` component from the main app.

## Next Steps for Debugging

1. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure Supabase URL and API keys are correctly set in your Vercel environment.
   - Double-check that the API keys have not expired.

2. **Check Database Access**:
   - Verify Row Level Security (RLS) policies for relevant tables to ensure proper access for authenticated users.
   - Confirm the `user_roles` table structure matches your schema.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Use browser network tools to verify the auth requests have the correct headers.
   - Check that only one Authorization token is being sent (not sending the anon key as an Authorization header).

4. **Testing**:
   - Test login with known correct credentials.
   - Verify the user has proper roles assigned in the Supabase database.

These changes should help resolve the authentication issues by cleaning up the codebase, removing development shortcuts, and fixing the fundamental token handling issue in the authentication flow.
